# Stocks Feature Notes
This file must be kept up to date by the LLM whenever this feature changes.

## Purpose
- Stock screener and stock details experience (`/stocks` + `/stocks/[providerKey]`).
- Cache-first stock chart and valuation/fundamentals retrieval for UI-safe DTOs.
- Beginner-first report flow with progressive disclosure for advanced data.
- Multi-overlay stock chart supports PE, EPS TTM, and Revenue TTM overlays.

## Boundaries
- Route handlers stay thin and delegate to `src/features/stocks/server/*`.
- Valuation summary service is fail-soft: when Yahoo summary fetch fails and no DB cache row exists, it returns an empty normalized summary (null metrics) instead of throwing, to avoid crashing report prefetch/render.
- Public market-data chart API (`/api/public/stocks/[providerKey]/chart`) is cookie-less and edge-cacheable with range-based `Cache-Control`.
- Private chart API (`/api/stocks/[providerKey]/chart`) and trade-markers API (`/api/stocks/[providerKey]/trade-markers`) use shared route auth helper (`src/lib/http/route-handler.ts`) and delegate to feature/server services.
- Stock details sections (`StockChartSection`, `StockMetricsSection`, instrument header) use Cache Components (`'use cache'` + `cacheLife` + `cacheTag`) with public Supabase reads.
- Report route keeps public URL `/stocks/[providerKey]` and now uses a 2-column clarity-first layout:
  - left rail: quick facts + company profile + CEO/compensation + insider trades,
  - right rail: chart-first reading stream with business/geo tables, balance-sheet snapshot, earnings-call summary, peers, and expandable deep-dive notes.
- Report route includes an `Insights Widgets` section in the main reading stream:
  - small quarter-based charts (FCF, cash/debt, dividends, shares outstanding, expenses, valuation),
  - centered modal drill-down per widget with larger chart and explanatory copy,
  - v1 data source is intentionally hardcoded and shared across all tickers.
- Report content sections (`What They Own & Owe`, `Revenue by Products`, `Revenue by Geography`, `Earnings Call Summary`, peers, and deep dives) are currently hardcoded mock content pending provider wiring.
- Report content includes additional hardcoded concept blocks with quarter/year toggles:
  - revenue allocation ("Gdzie trafia kazda zlotowka przychodu"),
  - year-over-year KPI block ("Ten rok vs poprzedni rok"),
  - free-cash-flow explainer section.
- "Jak firma zarabia" now has two visuals for revenue understanding:
  - default `Sankey` flow rendered with `echarts-for-react` (segmenty przychodow -> koszty -> zysk netto) with print-like textures/dashed streams,
  - fallback `Kołowe` view (existing product/geo donuts).
- Sankey left-lane split is now based on geographic revenue mix (4 segments) instead of highly concentrated product split, to improve readability and avoid one dominant 98% stream.
- Price chart controls include a `Narracja` toggle (default ON for long ranges) that reveals labeled event annotations on vertical guides.
- Report stream now includes `Zarzad i insiderzy` section (`#sekcja-zarzad`) with leadership cards and insider timeline (demo data).
- Concept-heavy sections expose hover tooltips via an `i` icon to clarify definitions in-place.
- Report page uses placeholder illustrations from `picsum.photos` until final generated engravings are delivered.
- UI consumes normalized DTOs only; no Yahoo-specific payload shapes in components.
- Stock chart/report modules are split into focused helpers (formatters, view-model mapping, hover card rendering, and revenue-mix section helpers/cards) to keep single-file complexity under repo limits.
- Screener cards render a larger 1-month (`1M`) preview chart with visible X/Y axes and a monthly percentage tag sourced from cache-first daily price series.
- Daily chart ranges (`1M+`) are cache-first via `instrument_daily_prices_cache`; 1D uses direct intraday Yahoo fetch.
- Supported ranges: `1D`, `1M`, `3M`, `6M`, `1Y`, `3Y`, `5Y`, `10Y`, `ALL`.
- 1D chart uses `includePrePost=true`; if intraday data is unavailable, API returns fallback range `1M`.
- 10Y chart resolves to `ALL` when full 10-year coverage does not exist.
- Chart supports two display modes: `Trend (100)` and `Raw`.
- Price line color is semantic by selected-range trend:
  - up -> `--profit`,
  - down -> `--loss`,
  - flat -> `--chart-1`.
- Chart draw animation is intentionally slower and reduced-motion safe.
- `StockChartCard` overlays optional buy/sell trade markers from authenticated transactions.
- `StockChartCard` supports optional mock event markers (`Wyniki (konsensus vs raport)`, `Wazne wydarzenia`) rendered as vertical guides with top-band dots, hover highlight, and floating cards:
  - earnings card: estimate vs reported for both revenue and EPS,
  - company event card: headline, short context, and placeholder image.
  - global event card (`Wazne wydarzenia globalne`) with separate marker color and placeholder image.
  - optional `BUY/SELL uzytkownika (mock)` markers use plus/minus icons with size scaled by mocked position value.
  - event overlays are enabled only on longer ranges (`3Y`, `5Y`, `10Y`, `ALL`) and are generated as yearly mocked markers.
- Screener/search and chart hover tooltips were aligned with the shared editorial style baseline (consistent radii/borders, toned-down surface depth) without changing data behavior.
- Desktop polish follow-up adjusted `/stocks` shell/readability on large screens (search width containment, loader/skeleton geometry, and screener card density/rhythm).
- Desktop micro-pass for `/stocks/[providerKey]` refined chart controls and typography: grouped range/mode/overlay controls into clearer desktop panels, reduced chart-axis typographic noise, and tightened heading/row scale in valuation/sidebar blocks.
- Desktop report typography pass further aligned long-form sections (`StockReportMainContent`, `StockReportRevenueMixSection`, `StockReportFiveYearTrendAnalysisSection`, `StockReportConceptSections`): section titles normalized to a calmer scale, uppercase helper labels softened, and key financial values switched to `font-mono tabular-nums` for faster scan/comparison.
- Desktop follow-up pass on `InsightsWidgetsSection` aligned widget-card and modal rhythm with the report system: flatter modal chrome (`rounded-sm`), calmer micro-typography/tracking, denser card spacing on large screens, and reduced chart axis noise in both compact and expanded widget charts.
- `StockMetricsSection` now reads summary + cached 5Y PE overlay context and renders contextual valuation instead of only raw rows:
  - PE shown on a range bar with min/max/median markers and percentile-based wording (`history low/mid/high`),
  - additional multiples and fundamentals moved into calmer supporting lists.
- Report concept section `Ten rok vs ostatni rok` now includes per-metric sparklines for trend context next to point-in-time YoY numbers.
- Balance snapshot summary now uses deterministic natural-language risk interpretation (`Niskie/Umiarkowane/Podwyzszone`) via helper module `stock-report-balance-summary.ts`.
