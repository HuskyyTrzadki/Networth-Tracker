# Inspirations Notes

This file is now a short index. Canonical style rules live in:

- `inspirations/style-guide.md`

## References
- StockTaper landing and report density (visual direction only, no 1:1 copy):
  - `inspirations/landing.png`
  - `inspirations/stock_insights*.png`

## Non-negotiables
- Ink-first UI (`#393939` as baseline ink in day mode).
- Warm paper background (darker than plain white).
- Dashed border grammar for modules and separators.
- Mono-first typography for data readability.
- Minimal, quiet motion only.

## Image Workflow
- If a page asks for an illustration, generate it with the prompt template in:
  - `inspirations/style-guide.md`
